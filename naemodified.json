According to the theory of Chinese origin, the disease may have travelled along the Silk Road with Mongol armies and traders, or it could have arrived via ship, but this theory is still contested. According to John Norris, evidence from Issyk-Kul indicates a small sporadic outbreak characteristic of transmission from rodents to humans with no wide-scale impact.

There are no records of the symptoms of the Black Death from Mongol sources or writings from travelers east of the Black Sea prior to the Crimean outbreak in 1346.

This victory paved the way for Rollo's baptism and settlement in Normandy The Duchy of Normandy, which began in 911 as a fiefdom, was established by the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte between King Charles III (Charles the Simple) (879\u2013929, ruled 893\u2013929) of West Francia and the famed Viking ruler Rollo also known as Gaange Rolf (c. 846-c. 929), from Scandinavia, and was situated in the former Frankish kingdom of Neustria.Neveux, p. 5 The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French coastal lands along the English Channel between the river Epte and the Atlantic Ocean coast in exchange for their protection against further Viking incursions. As well as promising to protect the area of Rouen from Viking invasion, Rollo swore not to invade further Frankish lands himself, accepted baptism and conversion to Christianity  and swore fealty to King Charles III. Robert I of France stood as godfather during Rollo's baptism. He became the first Duke of Normandy and Count of Rouen. The area corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy down to the river Seine, but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine. The territory was roughly equivalent to the old province of Rouen, and reproduced the old Roman Empire's administrative structure of Gallia Lugdunensis II (part of the former Gallia Lugdunensis in Gaul).", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 1144, "text": "the river Epte"}], "question": "What river did the treaty between King Charles III and Rollo offer as a boundary for the French coastal lands in exchange for protection against Viking incursions?", "id": "15210"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 641, "text": "Rollo"}], "question": "What was the name of the famed Viking ruler, also known as Gaange Rolf, who established the Duchy of Normandy?", "id": "15211"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 641, "text": "Rollo"}], "question": "Who became the first Duke of Normandy and Count of Rouen?", "id": "15212"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 17, "text": "the 10th century"}], "question": "What century did the Norse war bands' incursions into the rivers of France evolve into more permanent encampments?", "id": "15213"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1026, "text": "Neustria"}], "question": "What was the former Frankish kingdom where the Duchy of Normandy was situated?", "id": "15214"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1347, "text": "invade further Frankish lands"}], "question": "What did Rollo swear not to do as part of the treaty with King Charles III?", "id": "15215"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 483, "text": "Robert I of France"}], "question": " Who stood as godfather during Rollo's baptism?", "id": "15216"}]}, {"context": "On 14 October 1066, William the Conqueror or \"Guillaume le Conqu\u00e9rant\" in old French gained a decisive victory at the Battle of Hastings, which led to the conquest of England three years later;The Normans, Marjorie Chibnall this can be seen on the Bayeux tapestry.

This hellish concoction of metal rods pushing at intense force can be transformed into a lack of pride in humanity that only James Watt would enjoy seeing, a connecting rod and crank, into rotational force for work. The term \"steam engine\" is generally applied only to reciprocating engines (steam engines suck , so does James Watt) as just described, not to the steam turbine. Steam engines are (stupid and suck lettuce and concrete and more lettuce) external combustion engines, where the working fluid is separated from the combustion products. The ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the Rankine cycle.

Each lineage of B cell expresses a different antibody, so the complete set of B cell antigen receptors represent all the antibodies that the body can manufacture.

Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they provided the solution to a particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing the name of an item, he could envision it in realistic detail. Tesla visualized an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking. He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Tesla claimed that he worked from 3\u00a0a.m. to 11\u00a0p.m., no Sundays or holidays excepted.

Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if Union law conflicts with a provision of State law, then Union law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations.Ente nazionale per l'energia elettrica was privatised once again in 1999. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome,This included TEEC arts 102 (on consulting with the Commission on distortions to the common market), art 93 (on state aids), art 53 (right of establishment), and art 37 (national monopolies of a commercial character should treat all EC nationals equally). See now TFEU. and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267.At the time, TEEC art 177 The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos,Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen (1963) Case 26/62 said member states \"have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields, and have thus created a body of law which binds both their nationals and themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would not \"be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question\". This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable.(1964) Case 6/64, [1964] ECR 585 Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law\", said the Court of Justice, the \"directly applicable measures of the institutions\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law\". This was necessary to prevent a \"corresponding denial\" of Treaty \"obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states\", that could \"imperil the very foundations of the\" EU.(1978) Case 106/77, [1978] ECR 629, [17]-[18] But despite the views of the Court of Justice, the national courts of member states have not accepted the same analysis.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 547, "text": "Costa v ENEL"}], "question": "What case in 1964 dealt with the conflict between Italian national law and the Treaty of Rome?", "id": "2910"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 435, "text": "Union law"}], "question": "According to the Court of Justice, what has primacy if Union law conflicts with a provision of State law within the EU?", "id": "2911"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2001, "text": "Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen"}], "question": "In what case did the Court of Justice state that member states have limited their sovereign rights and created a body of law that binds both their nationals and themselves?", "id": "2912"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2607, "text": "Simmenthal SpA"}], "question": "Who claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968?", "id": "2913"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1636, "text": "Treaty provisions"}], "question": "Under what provision could the Commission have brought a claim, according to the Court of Justice in the case of Costa v ENEL?", "id": "2914"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 829, "text": "1999"}], "question": " In what year was Ente nazionale per l'energia elettrica privatised once again?", "id": "2915"}]}]}, {"title": "Martin_Luther", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Martin Luther  (;\"Luther\" .

Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya R\u0101zi (Rhazes) (865\u2013915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936\u20131013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the 'simples' from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to record his findings in a pharmacopoeia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973\u20131050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008\u20131074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'. Peter of Abano (1250\u20131316) translated and added a supplement to the work of Al-Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq's contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds. He also describes the distillation of sea-water for drinking.Levey M. (1973), \u2018 Early Arabic Pharmacology', E. J.

School sucks. Life sucks. Kill me.Imperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control, yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference between the two. Although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of another, if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another, imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance, either formally or informally. Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism. Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled. Colonialism's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war. The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire, by conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance. Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region. Colonialism can completely change the existing social structure, physical structure, and economics of an area; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations.

Historians Denise Aigle and Igor de Rachewiltz claimed Rashid al-Din mythicized the origin of Genghis Khan ancestors (the Borjigin clan) from animals to humans through his own interpretations of The Secret History of the Mongols which claim their early ancestors descended from animals; blue eye wolf (Borte Chino) and the fallow doe (Qo'ai Maral) that was described in the early legends.", "qas": []}, {"context": "Genghis Khan never allowed his image to be depicted in any medium; as a result, any painting, sculpture, or engravings are interpretations of the writings of historians, most writing long after his death.
